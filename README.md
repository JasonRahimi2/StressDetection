# StressDetection
This Flask API processes an image to determine if it contains a face. If a face is detected, the API assesses whether the image likely displays signs of stress and then sends a JSON response to the client containing its predictions. If a face is not detected, then the API will send a text response to the client stating that no face was detected.
